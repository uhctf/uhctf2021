# Wanted!

## Description
The Most Wanted criminal is back! Our Federal Crime Unit has managed to intercept a picture from him. We believe he is hiding inside the building where this picture is taken. Can you help us locate this picture? We only need the name of the building he is standing on.

Enter the flag however you like, the exact way of writing and capitalization do not matter.

## Hints
1. <details><summary>16.67%: Finding the right building if you know the right city.</summary>Once you suspect which city the photograph is from, look up monuments for that city. Plenty of towers and large buildings can be seen in this picture, it shouldn't be hard to triangulate where it was taken from.</details>
2. <details><summary>50%: Finding the right city.</summary>Some flags can be seen near the center of the picture, just below the horizon. One flag in particular is common. Why are those flags there? Which city is this most likely?</details>
