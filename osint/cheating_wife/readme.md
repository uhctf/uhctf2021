# Cheating Wife

## Description
I saw a picture of a beautiful house on my ex-wife's smartphone. But before she could tell me where it was, she immediatelly ripped the phone out of my hands and wanted a divorce. Now I am pretty sure that my wife is cheating on me with the owner of this house. As I'm filthy rich and I have nothing else to do with my money, I want to buy this house and I don't care where it is located or what the name of the owner is. Just give me the street name where this house is located and I will forever be in debt to you.

## Hints
1. <details><summary>25%: Finding the right street if you know the right region.</summary>The street numbers on the houses are very high. Once you know the general area, looking up the street numbers should yield only a few candidates.</details>
2. <details><summary>50%: Finding the right region in the world.</summary>Can you read the text on the bottom of the license plate of the red car? From that you could deduce the town where this picture was taken.</details>
