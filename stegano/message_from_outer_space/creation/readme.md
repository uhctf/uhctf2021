Challenge file was created using the python wave module.

The file consists of high amplitude and low amplitude pulses that happen every second. During that second the first 500msec is the pulse itself followed by 500msec of nothingness (i.e., no sound).

See [generate_message.py](generate_message.py) for more information.
