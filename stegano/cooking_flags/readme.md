# Cooking Flags

## Description
Whoops, we spilled ketchup on our precious flag. Our friend CyberChef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) tried to help us out but only made it worse! They took a bunch of ingredients and combined them with the flag... Now it is totally gone, can you recover our flag?

Flag format: **UHCTF{...}**
