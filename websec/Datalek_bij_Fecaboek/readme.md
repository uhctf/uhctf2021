## Description
Oh no! Fecaboek leaked phone numbers of many L33T Hackers! Someone made an easy-to-use search engine to look up which numbers are impacted by the breach.

It is rumoured that the phone numbers of these high profile h@x0rs have been leaked as well:

- John Doe: 69790467185
- Jane Doe: 42024365755
- Microsoft Helpdesk which helps you remove malware: 13373516557

Of course, because only L33T Hackers are included in the breach, all phone numbers start with `69`, `420` or `1337`.

Also, there's this beautiful hacker I like who told me the last few digits of their phone number are `025`. "If you really are a leet hacker, you can find out the rest for yourself", they said. Can you help me find it?
