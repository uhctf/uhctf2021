# Kim Jong's Crypto

## Description
One of our intelligence officers managed to get hold of the original source code of an cipher algorithm developed by North Korea. They call it our supreme leader's perfect state-of-the-art encryption algorithm". Later that day, we also received intel of a message sent from Kim Jong Un to his friend Vlad.

Can you decipher the received ciphertext using the source code? You will be... royally rewarded.
