Part4 is simply a linear operation in which memcmp and memcpy is used. The last 16 bit is checked first and then later the first 16 bits of part4 are checked.

For part1,part2 and part 3, you can derive the following equations:
part1+part2 = 96
part2 = part3
part2 > 40
part1 - part2 - part3 < 0

This will give you '40 <= part2 <= 96'.
Then part2 must be divisible by exactly 2,3,4,6,8,12,16 when checked in range [2,20]. The only number that satifies this constraint for part2 is 48.
Finally, fill in the equation and get the result for part1, part2 and part3.
