# Hiding in plain data

## Description

Your government is trying to infiltrate a secret organisation, your
job is the decode the program used for access control. Field officers
have been able to extract the following binary. Can you find the
access keys? The programmers looked very confident that noone would
find it.

### To get started

You can do this challenge using only simple tools like `objdump` or
online decompilers, but it might be easier to use tools like `IDA Pro`
(paid) or `Ghidra` (free) to decompile the binary.

### Other information

I have yet not checked if it is easy to brute force this, but you
should not brute force this.

I'm still thinking about making this an easy guided challenge, but I
want to see how this goes. Also it might be a good idea include the
source code in [hint2](hints/2.md) by default if this is too hard.
